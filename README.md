I'm a backend developer skilled in JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I build robust and scalable web applications, focusing on crafting efficient server-side solutions and seamless API integrations. Currently exploring new tech, refining my skills, and creating projects that combine simplicity with functionality.
